add the location of conda to your PATH (if you did not add it via the installer). For me on an "All Users" install this is C:\ProgramData\Anaconda\Scripts
from an Administrator Powershell prompt change the Powershell Execution Policy to remote signed i.e. Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned, or from a non-admin Powershell prompt change the Powershell Execution Policy to remote signed i.e. Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
open an Anaconda Prompt and run conda init powershell which will add Conda related startup to a Powershell profile.ps1 somewhere in your user's profile.
